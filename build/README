README for MakeParallel
=======================

Make segments of ways parallel to each other.

In order to use this plugin you need to select four nodes
- the first node marks the beginning of the source segment
- the second node marks the beginnging of the destination segment
- the third node marks the end of the source segment
- the fourth node marks the end of the destination segment

- first and third node should be part of the same way and can't be part of
  multiple ways
- idem for second and forth node

- nodes will be added or removed from the destination segment to match the
  number off nodes in the source segment
- plugin will abort if the removed nodes have tags or are part of multiple ways
